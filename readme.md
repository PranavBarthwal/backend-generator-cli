# Backend Project Template

This is a backend project template generated by the `backend-generator-cli`. It helps you quickly scaffold a basic backend project structure with essential folders, files, and a dummy `package.json`.

## Project Structure

After running the generator, the following structure will be created:

```
📁 src
   ├── 📁 controllers
   ├── 📁 db
   ├── 📁 middlewares
   ├── 📁 models
   ├── 📁 routes
   ├── 📁 utils
   ├── app.js
   ├── constants.js
   ├── index.js
📁 public
   ├── 📁 temp
.env
.env.sample
.gitignore
.prettierrc
.prettierrcignore
README.md
package.json
```

### Installation

To get started, you can install the `backend-generator-cli` globally via npm:

```bash
npm install -g backend-generator-cli
```

### Usage

Once installed, you can generate a backend project structure by simply running the following command:

```bash
backend-gen
```

This will create a folder structure like the one shown above, including a `package.json` template.

### Template Features

- **Basic folder structure**: Includes folders for controllers, models, routes, middlewares, and more.
- **Dummy `package.json`**: A basic `package.json` file with sample scripts and dependencies (`express`, `mongoose`).
- **Pre-configured `.env` files**: Template for environment variables with `.env.sample`.
